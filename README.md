## Project Description

Cancer is the leading cause of death in the world and is the second most common cause of death in the United States. However, considering the frequency of cancer, the access to cancer treatment remains unequal depending on the socioeconomic status of the individual patient, reflecting a pattern similar to that of the American healthcare system as a whole. We aim to investigate this inequality and provide insight into social disparities in the broader context of the current healthcare system.

There are numerous research articles about disparities in cancer treatment. According to an article by the National Cancer Institute[^1], the significant factors in healthcare disparities are social, environmental, and economic in nature. Thus, a research article by O'Keefe, Meltzer and Bethea[^2] focuses on the interplay between race and the socioeconomic factor, establishing that these two components interact and are not independent of one another. Lastly, the article "Global Health Equity: Cancer Care Outcome Disparities in High-, Middle-, and Low-Income Countries
"[^3] shows that economic status plays a role in cancer healthcare equity across the world, not only in the U.S.

We will begin by working with a dataset created and collected by the CDC’s National Center for. We accessed this dataset via the CDC’s webpage and consider it a highly valid source. For the economic dataset, we will be exploring a dataset collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) program.

Healthcare is a universal issue, as it is a necessity to be able to survive in the modern world. Therefore, healthcare issues involve everyone as a stakeholder. This dataset can be used to show how underserved populations interact with healthcare and how much access they have to healthcare. Getting more specific, This dataset would be a great resource for those looking to see trends within healthcare accessibility of cancer treatment for those in underserved communities.

“Where should you go for the best cancer treatment?” — this is a very hard question because there are various standpoints regarding which factors provide the "best value". Considering demand and supply methodologies as well, sometimes places where treatment would be of high demand need to be looked at. Medical treatment has become a business in an aspect, which is a great segway to our next question — how are certain statistics different in areas where the median income is above a certain amount? There might be great insights into the data we are going to be using.

## Technical Description

We anticipate the final format of our project to be an online page created with an HTML file that will adequately visualize the intersections between cancer treatment and socioeconomic disparities. Something that we can learn throughout the overall process is CSS and various styling mechanisms for our final HTML.

Some challenges we may face in the process of collecting data are merging appropriate data to address our answers to the problem as well as finding sufficient data that will effectively address our main question. Finding data that suit our initial purpose will be our toughest challenge; with our overall focus concentrating on discovering the social implications and inequalities that accompany various aspects of cancer, we will have to find data that supports our purpose in terms of revealing those points. Thus, given that there possibly could be no correlation between the number of diagnoses and the actual genetic and physical difference among certain groups that we will be comparing, we have to be careful not to link the conclusions we discover to an actual health implication, rather concentrating on various circumstances that either delay or fully prevent cancer diagnoses.
